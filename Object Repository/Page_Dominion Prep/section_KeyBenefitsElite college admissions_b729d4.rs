Benefits
Elite college admissions and awarded scholarships* go to students with higher levels of academic achievement, specialty higher level knowledge and broader areas of exposure. Accelerating Learning in a Mastery Based System makes this possible and is unavailable for achieving students at government funded and traditional schools.
            
                
                    
                    Accelerated Learning
Picking quality achieving students who can do better, so, they are scheduled at an advanced
pace. This allows higher academic achievement in less time.
                
                
                    
                    Better Quality Learning
The Dominion System combines custom developed specialty curriculum, unavailable elsewhere, with small class sizes and Face-to-Face Socratic Instruction so teachers can make sure that students master the material in a rapid manner.
                
                
                    
                    Extraordinary Opportunities
Parents can pick the courses as a supplemental or full-time program as well as picking courses, teachers, and times. Done in a remote manner
saves time and money while allowing students to attend their in-person school of choice, travel, participate in sports or get additional specialty studies in other areas of interests along with early college coursework – when ready.
                
                
                   *Dominion Prep is focusing on Group 1 and Group 2 type students from Founder’s previous school. COVID graduate year report is HERE.
