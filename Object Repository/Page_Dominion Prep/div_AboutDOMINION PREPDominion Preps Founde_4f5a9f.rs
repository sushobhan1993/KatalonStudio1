DOMINION PREP
Dominion Prep’s Founder set out on a mission to help people lead more fulfilling lives and create a better world. The best way to accomplish this for current and future generations is by creating better educational institutions, especially in the K-12 life years, which he has done for more than a decade. Our Founder started in the education reform movement in 2004, and opened his first school in 2008.
The Founder recognized the vast changes in society and education from COVID response, and political interest groups, around education. They do not have students’ education as the priority. The achieving students are suffering with boredom and educational loss, while schools are no longer safe from disease, drugs, violence, and strange political indoctrination. But strategically COVID did present a new opportunity. Based on things learned and practiced at Founders’ personalized learning school, Dominion Prep has started with a classroom launch date of December 2022, Winter Semester.
